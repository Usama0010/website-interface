Design a CI/CD pipeline for a project
1. Setup GitHub Repository:
   - Create a new GitHub repository with the desired name.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file.

2. Branching Strategy:
   - Use Git commands to create branches locally and push them to the remote repository.

   ```
   # Create and switch to the dev branch
   git checkout -b dev
   git push origin dev

   # Create and switch to the test branch
   git checkout -b test
   git push origin test

   # Create and switch to the main/master branch
   git checkout -b main
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Set up GitHub Actions for Code Quality Checks:
   - Create a workflow file (code_quality.yml) in the .github/workflows directory of your repository.

4. Admin Approval for Pull Requests:
   - Enable branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings for the dev branch.
   - Require pull request reviews before merging.
   - Assign an admin for each group who can approve pull requests.

5. Unit Testing Workflow:
   - Create another workflow file (unit_testing.yml) in the .github/workflows directory.

6. Integration with Jenkins for Containerization:
   - Set up Jenkins and install necessary plugins for GitHub integration and Docker support.
   - Create a Jenkins job triggered by a webhook from the GitHub repository.
   - Configure the Jenkins job to listen for successful merges to the main or master branch.

7. Email Notification for Admin:
   - Use Jenkins email notification plugin to send an email to the admin upon successful execution of the Jenkins job.
   - Configure the email notification to include details like job status, commit information, etc.

8. CI/CD Pipeline Overview:
   - Developer pushes changes to the dev branch.
   - GitHub Actions workflow checks code quality using Flake8.
   - Admin reviews and approves pull requests to merge changes into the dev branch.
   - Upon merge, GitHub Actions workflow deploys changes to the test branch and runs unit tests.
   - If unit tests pass, changes are merged into the main or master branch.
   - Jenkins job is triggered, which containerizes the application and pushes it to Docker Hub.
   - Admin receives an email notification upon successful execution of the Jenkins job.

This breakdown shows how each step is implemented using the provided tools and services, following the requirements outlined in the project.
